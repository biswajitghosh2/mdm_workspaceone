# mdm_workspaceone
This is the master repository for all scripts, sensors, custom profiles which is deployed for iOS, macOS and Android in Workspace One.

## Repo Structure

The repo structure has been aligned in a way to categorize the scripts, sensors, profiles as below:

-- iOS_scripts
-- iOS_sensors
-- iOS_profiles
-- macOS_scripts
-- macOS_sensors
-- macOS_profiles

The profiles will only contain custom "xml" code since which would include the options that are not available in DDUI and are inserted via payloads.
